I hope you know that you are deserving of everything you want in life. You deserve to be surrounded by people who grow your mind, people who make you better because they push you to be better. You deserve the kind of confidence that makes you believe that anything is possible, the kind that empowers your voice and your ideas and your capacity to seek out the things that you desire. You deserve moments of pure and intense happiness, the kind that make you feel your heart beating against your chest, the kind that dizzy you and make you realize that everything will be okay. Because it will be. It will be. At the end of the day, you deserve to be inspired by your life. I hope you never forget that. I love you.❤️</p></div>
